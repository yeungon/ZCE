# Practise makes perfect

A number of code snippets, most of them are relatively short, can be found in the folder named "practice". You can fork them if you want to have a look via localhost. You can even find the anwser for each question within the file listed. Normally in each file, there is an echo or print line which output something either string or integer. You have to calculate when looking the code snippet to find the output by yourself if you want to do some practice.
